                        <h3>Wake Up The Reality</h3>
                        <p>Have you ever wondered about the past of Uchiha Madara, one of Naruto's most justified
                            enemies?
                        </p>
                        <span>Madara Uchiha (うちはマダラ, Uchiha Madara) was the legendary leader of the Uchiha Clan. He
                            founded Konohagakure alongside his childhood friend and rival, Hashirama Senju, with the
                            intention of bringing about an era of peace. When the two couldn't agree on how to achieve
                            that peace, they fought for control of the village, a conflict which ended in Madara's
                            death. Madara, however, rewrote his death and went into hiding to work on his own plans.
                            Unable to complete it in his natural life, he entrusted his knowledge and plans to Obito
                            shortly before his actual death. Years later, Madara would be revived, only to see his plans
                            foiled and ultimately, and finally, realising the error of his ways and making amends with
                            Hashirama before his final death.</span>

                        <p>In real life, it seems that true peace, like what Naruto fought for, is unrealistic, and
                            therefore unattainable. Naruto's ideals were well-intentioned, but ultimately naive with how
                            humans think and act.
                        </p>
                        <span>In our world, the main reason there isn't a WWIII is because many countries currently have
                            nuclear weapons and are at a stalemate right? I'm not saying Pain's ideals are without flaw,
                            but what better alternatives could be made, in our world or the Naruto-verse?</span>

                            of the Eight Gates technique and others relying on the powers of the Six Paths.

                        </h3>
                        <p>Boruto is highly gifted and often speculated to be on the same level as Naruto. However, Naruto is stronger than Boruto. 
                        </p>
                        <span>Naruto and Boruto Uzumaki are famed for being the most powerful father and son duo in the Anime world and have stirred quite a superiority debate on who is more powerful.Boruto Uzumaki is the son of Naruto Uzumaki and Hinata Hyuga. He is an exceptionally skilled prodigy, much so that he is regularly compared to his father, Naruto. Much of Boruto’s power was gained after he was marked by Momoshiki’s Karma seal, while Naruto’s power comes right from the time of his birth from Kurama the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox.</span>
