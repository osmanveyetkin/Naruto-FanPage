                <h1>Is Boruto Stronger Than Naruto?</h1>
                <div class="contents">
                    <p class="v1">Boruto is highly gifted and often speculated to be on the same level as Naruto.
                        However, Naruto is stronger than Boruto. Naruto and Boruto Uzumaki are famed for being the most
                        powerful father and son duo in the Anime world and have stirred quite a superiority debate on
                        who is more powerful.
                    </p>
                    <p class="v2">
                        Boruto Uzumaki is the son of Naruto Uzumaki and Hinata Hyuga. He is an exceptionally skilled
                        prodigy, much so that he is regularly compared to his father, Naruto. Much of Boruto’s power was
                        gained after he was marked by Momoshiki’s Karma seal, while Naruto’s power comes right from the
                        time of his birth from Kurama the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Who is Stronger, Naruto or Boruto?</h5>
                    <p class="v2">
                        The question, is Boruto stronger than Naruto?, is a recurring subject of debate in the Naruto
                        anime world. Comparing Boruto with his father, Naruto, is not far-fetched. Although Naruto is
                        very powerful, his son has achieved much to match up and surpass him in some statistics.



                        According to Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, Boruto’s attributes are 120 in strength, 130 in
                        perception, 90 in intelligence and negotiation, and 160 in dexterity. While Naruto’s abilities
                        are 170 in negotiation, 110 in strength, 120 in perception, 160 in dexterity, and 90 in
                        intelligence.
                    </p>
                    <p class="v2">
                        The above analysis makes Boruto superior to Naruto, albeit on paper, because in actual practice,
                        expertise and attitude also matter, and Naruto excels in these areas by a wide margin. Naruto
                        has grown more mentally resilient due to having not only engaged in more battles but also having
                        to deal with more challenges as a child. Thus, Naruto is stronger than his son Boruto.


                        Even with Boruto having the Momoshiki’s Karma seal, Naruto is still significantly stronger. The
                        two might be considered to be at par since Naruto is currently lacking Kuruma. But with his
                        Baryon mode and the Kurama, the most powerful character in Boruto: Next Generations so far is
                        Naruto.

                        Given that Boruto is still developing his skills and abilities and Naruto has likely reached the
                        peak of his power, it is not out of place to believe that Boruto will eventually surpass Naruto
                        in the future. This assertion is made possible because, in the opening scene, where Boruto is a
                        teenager, he appears to be fully in control of the Karma seal. But for now, before he can
                        compete with his father, Boruto must first mature.

                        <br><br>
                        How Strong is Naruto?
                        One of the most popular characters in the Anime world is Naruto Uzumaki, and he is equally
                        regarded as one of the strongest characters in the anime and manga world too. He is the hero of
                        the hidden leaf village, Hinata Hyuga’s husband, and the father of Boruto and Himawari Uzumaki.
                        <br><br>
                        Within his franchise and by the standards of shonen protagonists in general, Naruto is
                        extraordinarily strong. He can take on even the toughest foes in the Naruto series thanks to his
                        arduous training, proficiency in a supernatural combat technique, and the Kurama. There are
                        currently very few characters in the Boruto: Naruto Next Generations sequel series who can even
                        come close to matching Naruto’s skill in battle.
                        <br><br>

                        Naruto is the Seventh Hokage of Konohagakure, the strongest shinobi in the Naruto Anime world,
                        the Jinchuriki of Kurama, also known as the Nine-Tails, and has access to the chakra of all the
                        other Tailed Beasts.
                        <br><br>

                        Naruto’s Skills, Abilities, Forms, and Powers
                        Over the years, Naruto Uzumaki has mastered several skills, abilities, forms, and powers, each
                        with a unique degree of strength. Here are some of the abilities he is known for:
                        <br><br>
                        Super Tailed Beast Rasenshuriken
                        The Super Tailed Beast Rasenshuriken is both Naruto’s and the franchise’s most powerful attack.
                        This technique creates a deadly assault that no opponent can expect to defend against by fusing
                        the shape and nature transformation of the Rasenshuriken technique with the distinct chakra of
                        each of the tailed monsters.
                        <br><br>
                        It is the result of all of Naruto’s labor and integrates practically every skill he acquired
                        throughout the series. This technique is unique to Naruto in the anime and makes him more
                        powerful than any of his powers.
                        <br><br>
                        Multiple Shadow Clones
                        With the help of his signature move, the Shadow Clone Jutsu, Naruto can effectively turn himself
                        into an army and defeat most of his opponents. While most characters in the anime can use this
                        method, Naruto’s higher-than-average chakra reserve allows him to produce a much greater number
                        of clones than most others.
                        <br><br>
                        This method, used in many of Naruto’s most powerful attacks, has become a pillar of his fighting
                        style. This technique is likely one of his most prominent powers, as it allows him to speed up
                        his training and master new skills faster.
                        <br><br>
                        Illusion Immunity
                        Naruto acquires a near-total immunity to genjutsu and other methods that influence his various
                        senses once he befriends Kurama. The only way for a Naruto character to get out of a genjutsu is
                        usually with the assistance of another character.
                        <br><br>
                        Kurama, an additional consciousness that resides inside of Naruto, has the power to
                        instantaneously deliver Naruto from any technique that tampers with his perception of reality.
                        The orange ninja’s immunity to these techniques makes him highly powerful, even though genjutsu
                        largely takes a backseat for the rest of Naruto.
                        <br><br>
                        Chakra Transfer
                        Similar to when Naruto initially tapped into Kurama’s chakra, Naruto can give Kurama’s chakra to
                        other ninjas and enhance their physical abilities. By enhancing their capacity for healing, he
                        uses this power to aid injured ninjas in their wound recovery. He also amplifies the strength of
                        those who are still in fighting form.
                        <br><br>
                        With the help of this skill, Naruto can significantly improve the overall combat prowess of the
                        Allied Shinobi Forces during their battle with the terrifying Ten-Tails. While Hinata can
                        briefly share specialized chakra with Naruto, no other Naruto character is capable of performing
                        this technique on the same level. Naruto now plays an even more crucial role in the Naruto Anime
                        army.
                        <br><br>

                        The Rasengan
                        Naruto learned how to use the Rasengan, a very powerful attack, from Jiraiya, his father’s
                        teacher. The Rasengan enables Naruto to inflict incredible amounts of damage on an opponent in a
                        very short time by rotating the chakra accumulated on his palm at an incredible speed.
                        <br><br>
                        In Naruto, Rasengan’s concentrated destructive power is practically unmatched, enabling the main
                        character’s ninja to overpower formidable foes in locations where his massive assaults are
                        ineffective. It is undeniably one of the most potent jutsu in the series and one of Naruto’s
                        most well-known moves for a reason.
                        <br><br>
                        Nine Tails Chakra Mode
                        Naruto can switch into the Nine-Tails Chakra Mode after beating the Demon Fox Kurama and
                        eventually befriending him. This transformation covers Naruto with a golden aura, drastically
                        improves his physical prowess, and gives him access to an enormous quantity of incredibly potent
                        chakra.
                        <br><br>
                        Naruto became one of the strongest characters in the entire series as soon as he underwent this
                        metamorphosis, and he can now battle even the most deadly foes while still being only a small
                        portion of his full strength. He is one of the few characters in the series with access to this
                        kind of power; hence, it is excessively powerful.
                        <br><br>
                        The Sage Mode
                        Naruto was able to enter Sage Mode after discovering how to harvest and control natural energy
                        from mystical toads. With the help of this technique, all of his physical abilities are
                        substantially increased, enabling him to fight opponents who would ordinarily be well beyond his
                        reach.
                        <br><br>
                        Sage Mode helped him destroy four of the six paths of pain, and he may combine it with his
                        previous transformations to increase his power even more. While other characters in the series
                        eventually develop their own Sage Mode techniques, Naruto’s usage of the transformation combined
                        with his other abilities renders him virtually unbeatable.
                        <br><br>
                        Baryon Mode
                        This specific power-up debuted in the Boruto series and is something Naruto wasn’t aware he had.
                        This is because using the Baryon mode comes at a high cost and is only accessible to the
                        jinchuriki housing Kuramma. In the case of Naruto, Baryon Mode fuses Kurama’s chakra with his
                        jinchuriki.
                        <br><br>
                        The chakra makes Naruto stronger, faster, and more lethal to an opponent as the two combine to
                        create a new form of energy. But using Baryon Mode comes with a hefty price tag. Kurama warns
                        Naruto that using it will result in death, but Naruto decides to use it nonetheless because he
                        has no other choice. However, in reality, it doesn’t end in the death of the jinchuriki, rather
                        the Tailed Beast inside of them.
                        <br><br>
                        Super Speed
                        Naruto can move very rapidly, like many other ninjas in the series. Naruto can move so swiftly
                        that it almost seems as though he is teleporting, unlike most of the characters who perform the
                        notorious Naruto run.
                        <br><br>
                        Only the most talented or competent of enemies can even keep up with Naruto’s movements after he
                        gains access to Kurama’s enormous pool of chakra. With his increased speed, Naruto was able to
                        defeat even the most well-known ninja in history during the Fourth Great Ninja War and achieve
                        what hundreds of other ninjas were unable to.
                        <br><br>
                        Flight
                        One of Naruto’s abilities is flight. Naruto perfects the skill of flight just before the
                        original series ends. When he combines his abilities with the power he gained from the Sage of
                        the Six Paths, he can fly through the air with ease.
                        <br><br>
                        This ability is crucial in his ultimate conflict with Kaguya since it enables him to attack the
                        cosmic being from many angles and easily go through the dangerous environment she warps to. It’s
                        not entirely obvious if Naruto is still able to fly, and this talent doesn’t occur very
                        frequently in the anime, but it is still highly valuable.
                        <br><br>
                        Rapid Recovery
                        The Nine-Tailed Demon Fox Kurama and Naruto have a symbiotic relationship. Due to the
                        devastation that could result if Naruto were to sustain fatal injuries, Kurama considerably
                        enhances Naruto’s healing capabilities as the Tailed-Beast is locked inside of him.
                        <br><br>
                        Naruto can quickly heal from most lacerations and puncture wounds in a matter of minutes, thanks
                        to this healing enhancement. While this ability doesn’t grant Naruto immunity to poisons or let
                        him heal quickly enough to reverse the harm, it does allow him to recover from injuries far
                        faster than most other ninjas.
                        <br><br>
                        How Strong is Boruto?

                        Boruto, who comes from two powerful bloodlines, is a prodigy. He is thought to be able to
                        succeed in anything he sets out to do because he can pick up new skills quickly. Despite his
                        young age, he has achieved several Jonin-level achievements, earning him the title of elite
                        Genin. Mitsuki thinks that, as a result, he will undoubtedly become Hokage at some point.

                        He swiftly rose to become the second-best student at the Academy, only falling short of the much
                        older Iwabee Yuino, who Boruto could still challenge. Boruto’s potential was recognized by
                        Sasuke, who chose him to be his disciple. Boruto developed his abilities to a point where they
                        were essential to defeating the Mujina and Momoshiki bandits.
                        <br><br>
                        Some of Boruto’s Powers, Skills, and Abilities Include:
                        The Karma Seal
                        The Karmaseal of the otsutsuki clan that Boruto acquires after defeating Momoshiki is the best
                        result of his victory. It appears as a diamond-shaped mark on his hand that, when activated,
                        forms lines and patterns that cover the entire length of his arm and a portion of his face.
                        <br><br>
                        He can use Momoshiki’s abilities to his advantage, greatly increasing his strength and granting
                        him control over nearby energies. However, the Karma seal allows Boruto to open doors to other
                        realms and planets.
                        <br><br>
                        The Gentle Fist
                        The Gentle Fist is a unique technique used only by members of the Hyuga family that allows a
                        ninja to target an opponent’s chakra pathway directly. Such an attack harms the organs close to
                        or surrounding the chakra pathway and weakens the opponent’s chakra.

                        The person’s chakra serves as the weapon that inflicts these wounds by piercing the enemy’s skin
                        and inflicting harm. Being a member of the Hyuga family, Boruto also knows this technique,
                        though he hasn’t used it to its full potential in combat yet.
                        <br><br>
                        The Jogan Dojutsu
                        In many ways, Boruto is Talented and Skilled. Since birth, he has inherited the talents of his
                        gifted parents, and at the age of eight, a dream causes Jogan to manifest in one of his eyes.

                        Since then, his right eye has allowed him to protect himself in situations of extreme peril by
                        alerting him to potential threats. With experience, he can turn it on like a light switch and
                        see things that a normal eye cannot. He can observe another person’s chakra, including its flow
                        and all subtle and significant changes.
                        <br><br>
                        The Shadow Clone
                        Before enrolling in the Academy, Boruto had mastered the Shadow Clone Technique. By coordinating
                        his attacks with them, he could use his shadow clones for Chunin, if not Jonin-level maneuvers.
                        He learned shuriken-jutsu from Sasuke and is proficient in it. Boruto can alter a weapon’s
                        trajectory while in flight and coat his shuriken with Lightning Release.

                        Additionally, he has picked up many of his father’s sexy techniques. As an adult, he was
                        observed using a sword in combat, demonstrating his proficiency in kenjutsu. After much effort
                        and Sasuke’s request, Boruto learns the Rasengan from Konohamaru Sarutobi, initially using both
                        hands.
                        <br><br>
                        Nature Transformation
                        Boruto is capable of three natural transformations: wind, lightning, and water release. He
                        employs a variety of tactics with these transformations, such as Lightning Release: Purple
                        Electricity, Water Release: Splash Bullet, and Wind Release: Gale Palm.

                        His ability to successfully use two elements at once shows off his talent for nature
                        transformation, compelling even his father to rely on a defense wall to fend off the attack. He
                        unconsciously imbued the Rasengan with lightning-natured chakra when he first created it, making
                        it his most powerful technique and a feat that no other user could do through conventional
                        ninjutsu.

                        The Nature transformation abruptly activates upon throwing the technique. This makes it
                        invisible, and then it tricks the opponent into letting their guard down as sufficient damage is
                        inflicted when it makes contact. Even though Boruto’s Rasengan starts small, he soon proved that
                        he could produce one that is regular size.
                        <br><br>
                        Rasengan
                        The late Fourth Hokage, Minato Namikaze, invented the renowned jutsu known as the Rasengan. It
                        has been used most recently by the Fourth’s grandson, Boruto Uzumaki, and has been passed down
                        from generation to generation.

                        Boruto demonstrates excellent use of the Rasengan in a number of his battles. Like his father,
                        he uses a clone to build and maintain the shape of the Rasengan. Still, he has also developed
                        variants such as the Vanishing Rasengan and the “Student-Teacher” Rasengan.

                        How strong is Naruto without Kurama?
                        After the battle with Isshiki Otsutsuki, Naruto lost Kurama, his main power source, and he may
                        no longer be as powerful as he once was. Despite this, Naruto is still incredibly strong and
                        possesses various skills he may employ to a dangerous level.
                        <br><br>
                        This is because he still has access to enter the sage mode and the tailed beast chakra, all the
                        five nature transformations, all his Kekkei Genkai, the ink creation, and many more. So, even
                        without Kurama, Naruto Uzumaki is still a formidable force. Although Naruto took full advantage
                        of Kurama’s power as jinchuriki, he has also developed several independent skills.

                        Even without Kurama, he has the ability to develop his skills even more because with the Sage
                        Mode, he still has access to all his five chakras. He can also learn infinite jutsu, in addition
                        to already having the Summoning Jutsu. Naruto was able to summon the mighty Gamabunta—a giant
                        toad who could fight against the Tailed Beast, thus learning the Reverse-Summoning Jutsu.

                        As a final icing on the cake, Naruto has the baryon mode, one of his strongest power-ups. With
                        his baryon mode, Naruto retains his position as one of the strongest anime characters.
                        <br><br>
                        What is Naruto’s Strongest Form?
                        Over the years, Naruto Uzumaki has created some strong forms, each with a unique degree of
                        strength. He could defeat his greatest enemies and those in his village with the help of each of
                        his forms. He has achieved a high level of power mastery and ascended to the top of the shinobi
                        age through his proficiency with various forms.
                        <br><br>
                        However, Naruto has a particular form that is regarded as his most powerful or strongest form:
                        the Baryon Mode. In Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, Naruto Uzumaki clinched a new
                        transformation that allowed him to channel the maximum output of a new power called the Baryon
                        Mode.
                        <br><br>
                        This form was created using Kurama’s and Naruto’s chakra as raw materials to birth a new and
                        stronger chakra, just like a nuclear fusion. Baryon Mode powered Naruto Uzumaki to great levels
                        and made him strong enough to overpower Isshiki Otsutsuki in battle. This transformation made
                        him the strongest character in the anime series and is also Naruto’s strongest form.

                        However, Instead of being a power-up with no repercussions, Baryon Mode raises the stakes
                        through the roof. It makes things much more exciting, which is yet another reason why it is
                        Naruto Uzumaki’s greatest power-up currently. This tremendous power comes at an equally
                        tremendous price, but its ability is far greater than anything seen in the Naruto franchise.
                        <br><br>
                        What Is Boruto’s Strongest Form?
                        Although Boruto Uzumaki is still young and developing his abilities and skills, he is well known
                        for his Karma seal. Boruto is in his strongest form when he wields power from the Karma seal.
                        His possession of this seal is regarded as one of his greatest abilities.

                        After obtaining sufficient power from the Karma seal, Boruto can compete in combat with Inners
                        of Kara, who possess gigantic strength and several technological advancements. When triggered,
                        the mark enlarges and stretches to encompass his full right arm and side of his face in a series
                        of very elegant lines.
                        <br><br>
                        It also allows Boruto to absorb almost any ninjutsu or energy-based target while drastically
                        enhancing his physical capabilities. Boruto may also create spatial portals that lead to other
                        realms with his Karma seal, which he possessed after defeating momoshiki.
