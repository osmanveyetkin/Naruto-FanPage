                <div class="contents">
                    <p class="v1">Madara Uchiha (うちはマダラ, Uchiha Madara) was the legendary leader of the Uchiha Clan. He
                        founded Konohagakure alongside his childhood friend and rival, Hashirama Senju, with the
                        intention of bringing about an era of peace. When the two couldn't agree on how to achieve that
                        peace, they fought for control of the village, a conflict which ended in Madara's death. Madara,
                        however, rewrote his death and went into hiding to work on his own plans. Unable to complete it
                        in his natural life, he entrusted his knowledge and plans to Obito shortly before his actual
                        death. Years later, Madara would be revived, only to see his plans foiled and ultimately, and
                        finally, realising the error of his ways and making amends with Hashirama before his final
                        death.</p>
                    <h5>I Think Madara Was Right;</h5>
                    <p class="v2">
                        Do you think the ideology of extermination of all life forms on Earth to reach peace is right?

                        What i think: They're right. Take a look at the world we live in. Understand your neighbor's
                        pain. Hungry, wars, torture, natural disasters, wild life, diseases, losing beloved ones, death
                        that awaits everyone (etc), always involving pain. You can't change some people's mind. There
                        will always be selfish people, who only care about themselves. Deep web is an example of it,
                        where there are gores and all that shit you probably know about, and another example of
                        selfishness are the wars. And you clearly can't change wild life, where one kills another one to
                        survive, how will you change animals' mind? Lots of insects are killed in the process of making
                        vegetable we eat, and eating animals' meat generates pain. So there's no way to eat without
                        harming a living being. How will you provide food for every sentient life on Earth without
                        harming another one? And with the population growing, the more lands (destruction of animals'
                        habitats, resulting deaths), food (which means, more animals will be killed) and water we will
                        need, increasing even more the wars. Lots of wars lie ahead. And sure, accidents will always
                        happen. We can't live without harm another one. And there are many other problems I didn't
                        mention. Wake up, we live in hell. It's impossible to turn this world into a paradise. There's
                        no way to prevent pain for every sentient life on Earth. As long as there's life on Earth,
                        there's pain. Obito and Madara are TOTALLY right.
