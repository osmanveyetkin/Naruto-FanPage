                        This will be a little complicated to explain, bear with me.

                        Let’s start with comparing the Narutoverse with real life. From mode of fighting to military to
                        general politics of affairs, they are poles apart. Therefore no matter how we try to apply the
                        logic of pain or naruto to real life problems, it will be counterproductive with no real
                        conclusion.

                        Now to look at the effectiveness of the two ideologies in the Narutoverse, IMO, what Pain said
                        would never work out. It would be the living example of cognitive dissonance. War for peace. The
                        reason is, the motive to fight doesn’t just end in Naruto with possession of the beasts. The
                        primary thing that would cancel it out would be the very existence of kekkei genkai- notably the
                        Sharingan which can control all the tailed beasts- which makes the individual much more powerful
                        than the State thus cancelling out the entire effectiveness of the plan. If Sasuke decides he
                        doesn’t give a shit about peace and wants to wreak havoc- he very well can and for the most part
                        it wouldn’t matter who possesses which beast after that.

                        Naruto’s idea- while utopian in standards of real life, is the most effective plan in the long
                        term in Narutoverse. Broadly speaking, he doesn’t deny the idea of crime and doesn’t vouch that
                        peace will be everlasting. But he convinces people to believe in the idea of peace.
                        Which....because it is an anime,,,,works. Because people give a shit what Naruto says. People in
                        general give a shit what other people say. That is why pain is allowed to give 15 full minutes
                        of detailed analysis of his plan and ideals in the middle of a fight to the death lmao. The
                        premise on which the show is built-Talk no jutsu- is rather effective and that is why idealism
                        will always be possible in Narutoverse. Also Naruto actually follows up on it by becoming the
                        hokage, making peace treaties, arranging summits etc. his legacy of peace shows in Boruto- with
                        children for who war isn’t a reality but something of history. In either case, I don’t think
                        Pain’s plan would be effective.
