                            Sakura Haruno is the apprentice of Tsunade Senju and a capable medical ninja. Along with
                            excelling in medical ninjutsu, Sakura is also a tremendous fighter, and this ability was
                            drilled into her by Tsunade as well.

                            By the end of the Naruto series, Sakura's Taijutsu skills are at an incredibly high-level
                            and she's capable of defeating most enemies with just a single blow. Coupled with her
                            Byakugou, she's extremely difficult to beat in combat. <br><br>

                            Sakura
                            quickly finds herself ill-prepared for the duties of a shinobi. However, after training
                            under the Sannin Tsunade, she overcomes this, and becomes recognised as one of the greatest
                            medical-nin in the world.

                            A user of the Gentle Fist technique, Neji was a prodigy of the Hyuga clan and a fine user of
                            the Byakugan Kekkei Genkai. Even as a child, Neji was powerful enough to defeat an adult
                            with ease.

                            As a Jonin, Neji's skill with the Gentle Fist technique was so immense that he was able to
                            deflect lots of 10-Tails attacks without much trouble. With the ability to stop the flow of
                            someone's chakra and deal internal damage, Neji's Taijutsu skills were lethal. <br><br>
                            <b>Neji Hyūga (日向ネジ, Hyūga Neji) </b> was a shinobi of Konohagakure's Hyūga clan. Though a
                            prodigy even by the Hyūga's standards, Neji was a member of the clan's branch house; no
                            matter how skilled he became, he would always be in service to the Hyūga's main house, a
                            fact that convinced him fate was predetermined. After experiencing Naruto Uzumaki's refusal
                            to be limited by such an ideology, Neji realised his fate was what he chose it to be, and as
                            a member of Team Guy he sought the strength necessary to make the future he wanted for his
                            family and friends, and ultimately sacrificed his life to protect the very same person who
                            taught him about the freedom of one's choice of fate, Naruto.

                            since he doesn't know how to use either Ninjutsu or Genjutsu.

                            With the power of the Eight Inner Gates, Lee grows stronger than your average Kage in
                            combat. His real strength as an adult remains to be seen. <br><br>
                            <b>Rock Lee (ロック・リー, Rokku Rī) </b> is a shinobi of Konohagakure's Lee clan and a member of

                            However, he overcomes those shortcomings by undergoing special training from Might Guy that
                            would make him a taijutsu master while still a genin.

                            arts, which included Taijutsu as well. Like Sakura and Tsunade, he could use his chakra to

                            combat, as seen when the two fought during their clash in the Valley of the End. With Sage
                            Mode, Hashirama's Taijutsu grew even more ferocious.

                            himself was hailed as the "God of Shinobi" for his unmatched ninja prowess. Hashirama sought
                            peace for the shinobi world, and to that end founded Konohagakure with his clan, his
                            childhood friend and rival: Madara Uchiha and the Uchiha clan. He would later become the
                            First Hokage (初代火影, Shodai Hokage, literally meaning: First or Founding Fire Shadow) of
                            Konohagakure. Although he was not able to achieve peace during his lifetime, his legacy and
                            vision for the world would continue to shape the village and the entire shinobi world even
                            after his death.

                            including Taijutsu. During the Fourth Great Ninja War, he showed what he was capable of when
                            he took on the entire Shinobi Alliance by himself and nearly killed them all.

                            Madara, as the Jinchūriki of the Ten-tails, grew even stronger and his Taijutsu was on a
                            different level compared to most characters in the Naruto world.

                            intention of bringing about an era of peace. When the two couldn't agree on how to achieve
                            that peace, they fought for control of the village, a conflict which ended in Madara's
                            death. Madara, however, rewrote his death and went into hiding to work on his own plans.
                            Unable to complete it in his natural life, he entrusted his knowledge and plans to Obito
                            shortly before his actual death. Years later, Madara would be revived, only to see his plans
                            foiled and ultimately, and finally, realising the error of his ways and making amends with
                            Hashirama before his final death.

                            While this may be surprising to some, Kaguya Otsutsuki is the strongest user of Taijutsu
                            users in the series and it is quite clear why from her fight against Naruto Uzumaki and
                            Sasuke Uchiha.

                            Using her Kekkei Mōra Jutsu, Kaguya can manifest the 80 Gods Vacuum Fist, a Taijutsu
                            technique strong enough to destroy a Six Paths Full-body Susanoo in just one blow. Along
                            with this, she had other techniques up he sleeve, such as the Rabbit Hair Needle, strong
                            enough to kill nearly anyone who stood in her path. Truly, Kaguya was a master of Taijutsu.

                            <b>Kaguya Ōtsutsuki (大筒木カグヤ, Ōtsutsuki Kaguya)</b>was a member of the Ōtsutsuki Clan and the matriarch of a branch family of her clan, including her children Hagoromo and Hamura. Long before the founding of the hidden villages, during an era of endless war, Kaguya betrayed her clan by consuming the fruit of the God Tree and became the first wielder of chakra on Earth, before later merging with the tree's Tailed Beast form in a battle against her children.
